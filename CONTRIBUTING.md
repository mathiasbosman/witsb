# Contributing to this repository

## Getting started

Before you begin:

- Make sure you use the Java version defined in [the pom file](pom.xml)
- Have you read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)?
- Check out the [existing issues](https://github.com/mathiasbosman/witsb/issues)

### Development guidelines

#### Code style

The code style used
is [the one defined by Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

#### Editor specific files

In case you use an IDE that has not yet been used before, and it generates IDE specific files make
sure to exclude this by adding them to the [.gitignore](.gitignore) file.

### Don't see your issue? Open one

If you spot something new, open an issue using
a [template](https://github.com/mathiasbosman/witsb/issues/new/choose). We'll use the issue
to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

### Ready to make a change? Fork the repo

Fork using GitHub Desktop:

- [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop)
  will guide you through setting up Desktop.
- Once Desktop is set up, you can use it
  to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

Fork using the command line:

- [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository)
  so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to
  merge them.

Fork with [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces):

- [Fork, edit, and preview](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/creating-a-codespace)
  using [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) without having to install and
  run the project locally.

### Make your update

Make your changes to the file(s) you would like to update.

### Open a pull request

When you're done making changes, and you would like to propose them for review create a pull
request.

### Submit your PR & get it reviewed

- Once you submit your PR, others from the Docs community will review it with you. The first thing
  you're going to want to do is a [self review](#self-review).
- After that, we may have questions, check back on your PR to keep up with the conversation.
- Did you have an issue, like a merge conflict? Check out
  our [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) on how to
  resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged

Congratulations!

Once your PR has been merged, you will be proudly listed as a contributor in
the [contributor chart](https://github.com/mathiasbosman/witsb/graphs/contributors).

### Keep contributing as you use the File Services

Now that you're a part of the GitHub Docs community, you can keep participating in many ways.

## Starting with an issue

You can browse existing issues to find something that needs help!

## Opening a pull request

You can use the GitHub user interface for some small changes, like fixing a typo or updating a
readme. You can also fork the repo and then clone it locally, to view changes and run your tests on
your machine.

## Reviewing

We review every single PR.

Reviews are always respectful, acknowledging that everyone did the best possible job with the
knowledge they had at the time.  
Reviews discuss content, not the person who created it.  
Reviews are constructive and start conversation around feedback.

### Self review

You should always review your own PR first.

For content changes, make sure that you:

- [ ] Confirm that the changes meet the user experience and goals outlined in the content design
  plan (if there is one).
- [ ] Write the necessary tests or adjust existing ones if needed.
- [ ] Make sure the application builds correctly.
- [ ] Review the content for technical accuracy.
- [ ] If there are any failing checks in your PR, troubleshoot them until they're all passing.

### Suggested changes

We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged. You can apply suggested changes
directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your
branch.
